## About 

This documentation is intended to guide you through your journey of developing smart contracts on Cardano with Plutus. The insights shared here are based
on the work done by the [Gimbalabs PPBL team](https://gimbalabs.com/ppbl) and hopefully it will be helpful to you. This documentation is meant to be living documents and will evolve.

## Overview of Cardano

Cardano is a third generation blockchain ecosystem. What makes Cardano quite unique is that it is developed from the ground up with original research
backed by peer reviewed whitepapers. Back in 2017, Charles Hoskinson did a whiteboard session about Cardano wherein he explained what are the challenges
Cardano intends to solve. It is definitely a recommended watch. You can find the video at the IOHK YouTube channel: [Cardano whiteboard - Overview with Charles 
Hoskinson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ja9D0kpksxw) 

The original essay from 2017 Charles Hoskinson outlining the background, philosophy and inspiration behind the Cardano blockchain can be found 
[here](https://why.cardano.org/en/introduction/motivation/).
