#Overview

This one is built around a use case for escrow between a provider and consumer of a service, implemented using Plutus contracts. Alice is (for example) a Plutus expert.
Bob needs help with Plutus. Alice is offering 60 minute blocks of time, where she offers 1:1 support on Plutus, at a rate of xx Ada/hour. Bob books an hour with Alice. 
When booking time, he places xx Ada in this escrow contract. The contract mitigates the counterparty risk by splitting up payment into tranches as well as by offering
a basic dispute registration and settlement mechanism.
