#Overview

This exercise addresses the question on how to use an NFT as an authentication token for obtaining some privileged access. 
This exercise showcases potential use of an NFT, for achieving the functionality of the OAuth protocol used for authentication 
in web applications. For example, the way you log in to a website using your Google or Facebook account. 

There is an endpoint that mints NFT for requesting wallets using the supplied Wallet ID and delivers it to the requestor wallet. 
The minted NFT has a token name equal to the public key hash of the requested wallet. This enables the receiving wallet to use the 
NFT for further transactions. An NFT will represent only 1 wallet.
