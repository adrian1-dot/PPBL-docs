#Overview

You might have undergone the Plutus Pioneer program and are now ready to implement your own smart contract. 
However, you might find that your code does not compile anymore with the latest version of Plutus.  This is 
expected, since Plutus is under active development and is evolving. This exercise intends to guide you through 
debugging the error and get your contract code to compile and run in the [PAB](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-starter).
