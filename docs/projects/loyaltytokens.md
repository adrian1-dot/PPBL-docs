#Overview

This one extends from some of the previous works, to illustrate a realistic use case of loyalty tokens. deals with inspecting or reading tokens that 
are held in a wallet. The loyalty tokens are assumed to be issued by a brand of some entity to their customers or clients. The issuer supplies loyalty 
tokens of different categories with associated rewards to its patrons. The rewards vary based on the class of the token. Using the idea of NFT based 
OAuth 2.0 and wallet probe, the rewards are encoded into the token issued for verification at a later point.
